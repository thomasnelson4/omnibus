// Deletes the ORIGINAL usenet download from the client's category folder (issue #198). Every
// external-client import COPIES into the library — that's seed preservation for torrents, but for
// NZBGet/SABnzbd it just strands the source file and its job folder forever. This helper removes
// exactly the job path the importer resolved, and nothing else. For SAB history.storage this
// is the final job directory, including sidecars and extraction subdirectories — not just the
// individual archive copied into the library. Never infer a job directory by walking upward
// from a bare file: its parent might be a shared category folder.
//
// Torrent clients (qbit/deluge) must never reach this — deleting their payload breaks seeding.
// Callers gate on client type; the type check here is defense in depth, not the primary gate.
